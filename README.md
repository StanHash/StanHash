Hi

I go by Stan or nat5. I live in France.

My primary hobby involves modding/reverse engineering classic video games (a.k.a. "ROM Hacking"). I have primarily worked on the GBA Fire Emblem games. I mostly work on tooling, documentation and disassembly/decompilation.

I am currently (as of November of 2024) a 2nd year master's student in computer science/software engineering.

I am not comfortable with most forms of communication, especially online. Please understand.
