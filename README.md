Yo!

I go by Stan (StanH_, StanHash, ...) or Nat (Nat5, Nat_776, ...). I like stylizing my handles in all lowercase ("stan", "nat"). I speak English :gb: :us: and French :fr: . I live in France.

My primary hobby involves modding/reverse engineering classic video games (a.k.a. "ROM Hacking"). I have primarily worked on the GBA Fire Emblem games. I mostly work on tooling, documentation and source code reproduction (disassembly/decompilation), but I occasionally also contribute my own mods.

I like simple/minimalist systems and environments (such as, unsurprisingly, classic video game consoles). I like C, Rust, and some assembly languages.

I am currently a 1st year master's student in computer science/software engineering (whatever "informatique" would translate to).

I am very much not comfortable with most forms of communication, especially online. Therefore I may not answer you immediately (and perhaps eventually forget). Please understand.
