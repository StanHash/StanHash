Yo!

I go by Stan (StanH_, StanHash, ...) or Nat (Nat5, Nat_776, ...). I like stylizing my handles in all lowercase ("stan", "nat"). I speak English :gb: :us: and French :fr: , and live in France. I am a nerd.

I do modding/reverse engineering of classic video games (a.k.a. "ROM Hacking"). I am best known for my work on the GBA Fire Emblem games. I mostly work on tooling, documentation and source code reproduction (disassembly/decompilation), but I do also contribute my own mods sometimes.

I like simple/minimalistic systems and environments (such as (surprise!) classic video game consoles). I like ASM, C, Rust and sometimes C#.

I am currently a 3rd year student in general computer science/software engineering (whatever "informatique" would translate to).

I am very much not confortable with most forms of communication. Therefore I may not answer you immediately, or forget. Please understand.
